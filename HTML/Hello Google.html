            <h1><b>Hello Google</b></h1> 
            <p>Search the world's information, including webpages, images, videos and more. <b>Google</b> has many special features to help you find exactly what you're looking.</p> 
            <h2>History</h2> 
            <p>Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California.[17][18][19] The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original <b>Google</b> Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[20][21] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.</p>
            <h2>Growth</h2>
            <p>In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[44] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[45] The next year, <b>Google</b> began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[46][19] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[47] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.</p>
            <h2>Initial public offering</h2>
            <p>On August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at <b>Google</b> for 20 years, until the year 2024.[56] The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[57][58] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[59][60] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.</p>
            <h2>Search Engine</h2>
            <p><b>Google</b> indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators.[112] According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%.[113] In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.</p>
            <h2>Advertising</h2>
            <p>Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on <b>Google</b> and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.</p>
