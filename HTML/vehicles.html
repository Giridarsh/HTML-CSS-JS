            To walk abroad is, not with eyes,<br>
            But thoughts, the fields to see and prize;<br>
            Else may the silent feet,<br>
            Like logs of wood,<br>
            Move up and down, and see no good<br>
            Nor joy nor glory meet.<br>

        <p>Mode of transport is a term used to distinguish between different ways of <b><i>transportation or transporting people or goods</i></b>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport#Modes"> more</a><br>
        There are 4 types of modes of transport. They are: </p>

            <ul>
                <div>
                <li><b>Aeroplane</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/aeroplane.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes <b><i>recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research.</i></b> Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport#Air"> more</a><br></p>
                <li><b>Helicopter</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/helicopter.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally-spinning rotors. This allows the helicopter to <b><i>take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward and laterally.</i></b> These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL (Vertical TakeOff and Landing) aircraft cannot perform. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter" width=200px> more</a><br></p>
                <li><b>Hot-Air Balloon</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/hotairballoon.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A hot-air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended beneath is a <b><i>gondola or wicker basket</i></b> (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot-air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air.<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-air_balloon"> more</a><br></p>

                <li><b>Car</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/car.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car"> more</a><br></p>
                <li><b>Bus</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/bus.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses while coaches are used for longer-distance services.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"> more</a><br></p>
                <li><b>Truck</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/truck.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work. Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cab that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck"> more</a><br></p>
                <li><b>Motorcycle</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/motorcycle.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, or cycle, is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle. Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport, including racing, and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"> more</a><br></p>

                <p>Coal trains today have 125-150 rail cars, making them up to 1.5 miles long (Black). ... The main purpose of transporting coal in trains is to load large amounts on ships to be sent to Asia, where it is burned for energy.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive"> more</a><br></p>
                <li><b>Diesel Train</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/diesel.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A diesel locomotive is a type of railway locomotive in which the prime mover is a diesel engine. Several types of diesel locomotives have been developed, differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the driving wheels.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive"> more</a><br></p>

                <p>A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat"> more</a><br></p>
                <li><b>Oil Ship</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/oil.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>An oil tanker, also known as a petroleum tanker, is a ship designed for the bulk transport of oil or its products. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker"> more</a><br></p>
                <li><b>Cargo Ship</b></li><br>
                <img src="pics/cargo.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A cargo ship or freighter is a merchant ship that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world's seas and oceans each year, handling the bulk of international trade. Cargo ships are usually specially designed for the task, often being equipped with cranes and other mechanisms to load and unload, and come in all sizes. Today, they are almost always built by welded steel, and with some exceptions generally have a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years before being scrapped<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship"> more</a><br></p>

            <img src="pics/functions.jpg" width=200px>
            <p>Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical relocation of armed forces during warfare, or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport#Functions"> more</a><br></p>

                <img src="pics/passengers.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A passenger is a person who travels in a vehicle but bears little or no responsibility for the tasks required for that vehicle to arrive at its destination or otherwise operate the vehicle. The vehicles may be bicycles, buses, passenger trains, airliners, ships, ferryboats, and other methods of transportation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger"> more</a><br></p>
                <li><h3><p>Freight</p></h3></li>
                <img src="pics/frieght.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the value chain in manufacturing. With increased specialization and globalization, production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport. Transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption. While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_transport"> more</a><br></p>

                <img src="pics/ambulance.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment, and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical care to the patient. The word is often associated with road-going "emergency ambulances", which form part of emergency medical services, administering emergency care to those with acute medical problems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance"> more</a><br></p>

            <img src="pics/impact.png" widht=200px height=200px>
            <p>The environmental impact of transport is significant because transport is a major user of energy, and burns most of the world's petroleum. This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_transport"> more</a><br></p>

                <img src="pics/planning.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of transport forecasting, planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the supply chain. Transport as a field is also studied through transport economics, a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. Transport engineering, a sub-discipline of civil engineering, must take into account trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and route assignment, while the operative level is handled through traffic engineering.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport#Planning"> more</a><br></p>

                <p>Transport is a major use of energy and burns most of the world's petroleum. This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport#Environment"> more</a><br></p>

            <img src="pics/history.jpg" width=200px>
            <p>The history of transport is largely one of technological innovation. Advances in technology have allowed people to travel farther, explore more territory, and expand their influence over larger and larger areas. Even in ancient times, new tools such as foot coverings, skis, and snowshoes lengthened the distances that could be traveled.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_transport"> more</a><br></p>

                <img src="pics/natural.png" width=200px>
                <p>Humans' first ways to move included walking, running, and swimming. The domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled (U.K. sledge) helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of vehicles.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport#Natural"> more</a><br></p>
                <li><h3><b>Infrastructure</b></h3></li>
                <img src="pics/infrastructure.png" width=200px>
                <p>Many early civilizations, including those in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, constructed paved roads. In classical antiquity, the Persian and Roman empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval Caliphate later built tar-paved roads.<br></p>
                <li><h3><b>Mechanical</b></h3></li>
                <img src="pics/mechanical.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible. The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With telegraphy, communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport#Mechanical"> more</a><br></p>
