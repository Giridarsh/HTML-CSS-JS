        <p>Transport or transportation is the movement of humans, animals and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include <b>air, land (rail and road), water.</b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"> more</a></p>

        <h2>Modes of Transportation</h2>
        <img src="pics/modesoftransport.png" width=200px>
        <p>Mode of transport is a term used to distinguish between different ways of transportation or transporting people or goods.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport#Modes"> more</a><br>
        There are 4 types of modes of transport. They are: </p>
            <h3><p>Airways</p></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Aeroplane</li><br>
                <img src="pics/aeroplane.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport#Air"> more</a><br></p>
                <li>Helicopter</li><br>
                <img src="pics/helicopter.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally-spinning rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL (Vertical TakeOff and Landing) aircraft cannot perform. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter" width=200px> more</a><br></p>
                <li>Hot-Air Balloon</li><br>
                <img src="pics/hotairballoon.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A hot-air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot-air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air.<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-air_balloon"> more</a><br></p>

                <li>Car</li><br>
                <img src="pics/car.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car"> more</a><br></p>
                <li>Bus</li><br>
                <img src="pics/bus.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses while coaches are used for longer-distance services.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"> more</a><br></p>
                <li>Truck</li><br>
                <img src="pics/truck.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work. Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cab that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck"> more</a><br></p>
                <li>Motorcycle</li><br>
                <img src="pics/motorcycle.jpg" width=200px>
                <p>A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, or cycle, is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle. Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport, including racing, and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"> more</a><br></p>
